*The India TB Pathways dataset is based on a study conducted in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. It examines the pre-diagnostic costs and health-seeking behavior of 880 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis patients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs).*

```{python}
india_tb=pd.read_csv('/Users/zorangavrilov/Desktop/graph_courses_python/india_tb/india_tb_pathways_and_costs.csv')
show(india_tb)
```

**Relationship between smoking habit and form of TB**

```{python}

form_of_tb_plot=px.hist_frame(india_tb, x='Smoking', color='Form of TB', text_auto=True)
form_of_tb_plot.show()
```

The distribution of the Form of TB among the smokers and non smokers seems to be similar.
