title: "Workshop 7: Using LLMs to Extract Information from Job Descriptions"
author: "Zoran Gavrilov"

# Introduction

For this week's workshop, you will analyze job posting data using Large Language Models (LLMs). You'll extract structured information from job descriptions and create visualizations to understand patterns in the data science job market.

# Setup

First, make sure this document is in your `graph_courses_python` folder, where your virtual environment is activated and you have the required packages installed.

Run the following code to load the necessary packages:

```{python}
from openai import OpenAI
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
from local_setting import (
    OPEN_KEY,
)  ## Assumes you have a local_settings.py file in your folder with your OpenAI key

# Initialize the OpenAI client
client = OpenAI(api_key=OPEN_KEY)
```

# Define an llm_chat function

Before we start our analysis, let's create a helper function to simplify interactions with the LLM.

Test the function below by asking the question "What is Python (the language) named after?"

```{python}
def llm_chat(message):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": message}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content


# Test the function here
llm_chat('What is Python (the language) named after?')
```

# Get the Data

The dataset to be used contains job postings scraped from the website Glassdoor. You can see the scraping project [here](https://github.com/picklesueat/data_jobs_data).

Download it from the website and place it in an appropriate location in your folder. 

Load the data into a pandas dataframe:

```{python}
# Your code here
jobs = pd.read_csv('jobs.csv')
jobs
```

# Task 1: Extracting Years of Experience Required

## Part A: Create and Apply LLM Function

We will use the LLM to extract the minimum years of experience required from job descriptions.

We have written the prompt for you. Vectorize the function, then apply it on the `job_description` column of the dataframe. Create a column called `years_required` in the dataframe to store the results.

```{python}
def yrs_exp(description):
    prompt = f"""
    Extract the minimum years of experience required from this job description. 
    Return ONLY a number. If a range is given, return the lower number.
    If no years of experience are explicitly mentioned, return 'NA'.
    Here's the job description:
    {description}
    """
    return llm_chat(prompt)

# Vectorize the function
yrs_exp_vec=np.vectorize(yrs_exp)

# Apply the function to the dataset
jobs['min_yrs_exp']=yrs_exp_vec(jobs['job_description'])
jobs
jobs.to_csv('jobs.csv',index=False)
```

Write the data to a CSV file and check if the results make sense by comparing them to the original job descriptions.

## Part B: Convert to Numeric

The `years_required` column is currently a string. Convert it to a numeric type using the `pd.to_numeric` function, with the `errors='coerce'` argument so that any non-numeric values are converted to `NaN`.

```{python}
# Your code here
jobs['min_yrs_exp']=pd.to_numeric(jobs['min_yrs_exp'],errors='coerce')
```

## Part C: Create Visualization

Create a visualization comparing years of experience required to the midpoint salary estimate. You'll need to:

- Create a scatter plot using Plotly Express.
- Use the `midpoint_salary_estimate` column for salary and `years_required` for the x-axis.

```{python}
# Your code here
yrs_exp_mid_salary=px.scatter(jobs,x='min_yrs_exp',y='midpoint_salary_estimate')
yrs_exp_mid_salary
```

Describe any relationships you see in the plot.
-no correlation

# Task 2: Extracting Programming Language Requirements

In this task, we will ask the LLM to extract the programming languages mentioned in the job descriptions.

## Part A: Create and Apply LLM Function

Now, create a function that asks the model about the programming languages mentioned in the job description. Specifically, it should return one of four categories regarding the languages mentioned: "R", "Python", "both", or "neither". This time, you'll need to craft the prompt yourself.

Apply your function to the dataset and create a new column `lang_req` in the dataframe to store the results.

```{python}
# Define the function here
def program_lang(description):
    prompt = f"""
    Extract the program languages from this job description. 
    Return ONLY a single word. Return R, Python, both if both languages are given or neither if none of them is given. 
    Here's the job description:
    {description}
    """
    return llm_chat(prompt)

# Vectorize the function
program_lang_vec=np.vectorize(program_lang)

# Apply the function to the dataset
jobs['program_languages']=program_lang_vec(jobs['job_description'])
jobs
jobs.to_csv('jobs.csv',index=False)


```

## Part B: Create Visualization

First, count the number of jobs that require each of the four categories:

```{python}
# Your code here
program_language=px.histogram(jobs, x='program_languages')
program_language
```

Create a box plot comparing salary distributions across the different programming language requirement categories:

```{python}
# Your code here: Create box plot using plotly express
salary_prog_lang=px.box(jobs,y='salary_estimate',x='program_languages')
salary_prog_lang.update_layout(
    yaxis=dict(
        categoryorder="array",  # Use a custom order for categories
        categoryarray=sorted(jobs['salary_estimate'].unique(), reverse=True)  # Sort values in descending order
    )
)
salary_prog_lang
```

Write a few sentences describing any patterns you see in the plot. (Note that this is a very small sample of jobs, so don't read too much into the results.)

# Optional Challenge: Most common technical skills. 

Use an LLM function to extract the most common technical skills mentioned in job descriptions, then create a visualization to illuminate the most common technical skills.

You will need to design your own approach to extract and standardize technical skills, being explicit in your prompt about what constitutes a technical skill. 

There's no single correct way to classify and standardize skills - document your choices and reasoning as you develop your solution.
