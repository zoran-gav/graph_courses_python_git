## Introduction

For this workshop, you'll be cleaning and modifying a dataset with functions like `drop()`, `rename()`, `to_numeric()`, and `replace()`. These have been covered in the last few weeks of the prework.

## Step 1: Load packages and data

To get started, **load in the needed packages**: `pandas`, `numpy`, and `plotly.express`.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
```

Now, read in the dataset called `physical_activity.csv` from your data folder and save it as `pa`.

It should have 142 rows and 9 columns.

```{python}
# your code here
pa=pd.read_csv('/Users/zorangavrilov/Desktop/graph_courses_python/physical_activity.csv')
```

## Step 2: Subset and rename variables

Next, drop the "personal_id" and "household_id" variables from the DataFrame.

```{python}
# your code here
pa=pa.drop(columns=['personal_id','household_id'])
```

Now, rename `oms_recommendation` to `who_recommendation`. (OMS is the French name for WHO.)

```{python}
# your code here
pa.rename(columns={'oms_recommendation':'who_recommendation'})
```

Your data should now have 7 variables: 

- `sex`: male or female 
- `status`: adult (Adulte) or child (Enfant) 
- `bmi`: body mass index 
- `sedentary_ap_s_day`: sedentary behaviour (seconds/day) 
- `light_ap_s_day`: light physical activity (seconds/day) 
- `mvpa_s_day`: moderate to vigorous physical activity (seconds/day) 
- `who_recommendation`: whether or not WHO recommendations for physical activity are met

## Step 3: Examine and convert data types

Let's think about the types of variables in our dataset. 

Check the data types that were automatically assigned to each variable with `info()`.

```{python}
# your code here
pa.info()
```

Notice that all of your variables are of type **object** (which is a catch-all for strings), but some    should be **numeric** (e.g., `bmi`). 

This is because the numeric variables have the words "missing" in them to indicate that the value is missing. Can you spot those words when you view the dataset?

We'll use the `pd.to_numeric()` function to convert these variables to numeric. 

Here is an example of how to use this.

```{python}
test_df = pd.DataFrame({"bmi": ["32.2", "missing", "18.8", "17.8", "21.1"]})
test_df["bmi"] = pd.to_numeric(test_df["bmi"], errors="coerce")
test_df
```

The missing values are represented as `NaN` after the conversion.

Now, fill in the blanks below to apply this to your `pa` DataFrame.

```{python}
# Change variables' type
pa["bmi"] = pd.to_numeric(pa["bmi"], errors="coerce")
pa["sedentary_ap_s_day"] = pd.to_numeric(pa["sedentary_ap_s_day"], errors="coerce")
pa["light_ap_s_day"] = pd.to_numeric(pa["light_ap_s_day"], errors="coerce")
pa["mvpa_s_day"] = pd.to_numeric(pa["mvpa_s_day"], errors="coerce")
```

```{python}
pa.info()
```
Check the data types again with `info()`.

## Step 4: Recode the `status` variable

Next, notice that the `status` variable currently uses the French terms "Adulte" and "Enfant". 

```{python}
# Run this code to check the values of status
pa["status"].value_counts()
```

Use the `.replace()` method to transform the `status` variable by replacing "Adulte" with "Adult" and "Enfant" with "Child".

```{python}
# your code here
pa['status']=pa['status'].replace({'Adulte':'Adult','Enfant':'Child'})

```

```{python}
pa
```

## Step 5: Convert the physical activity variables

There are 3 physical activity variables: sedentary behavior (`sedentary_ap_s_day`), light physical activity (`light_ap_s_day`), and moderate to vigorous physical activity (`mvpa_s_day`). 

These variables are currently measured in seconds per day.

However, most [recommendations](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/337001/9789240014886-eng.pdf) for physical activity are in minutes per week, so we want to align with these measures. 

To do this, complete the following manipulations:

1. Use arithmetic operations to create new variables called `sedentary_ap_m_wk`, `light_ap_m_wk`, and `mvpa_m_wk` that are in minutes per week.

2. Remove the previous seconds per day variables.

```{python}
# your code here
pa['sedentary_ap_m_wk']=pa['sedentary_ap_s_day']/60*7
pa['light_ap_m_wk']=pa['light_ap_s_day']/60*7
pa['mvpa_m_wk']=pa['mvpa_s_day']/60*7
pa.drop(columns=['sedentary_ap_s_day','light_ap_s_day','mvpa_s_day'])
```

## Step 6: Total physical activity

Create a new column that adds light physical activity and moderate to vigorous physical activity, and call it `total_pa_m_wk`. 

This should give us the total amount of activity in minutes per week. 

```{python}
# your code here
pa['total_pa_m_wk']=pa['light_ap_m_wk']+pa['mvpa_m_wk']
pa
```

## Step 7: Categorical variable for total physical activity

Write a custom function that bins its input variable into three categories:

- `low`: less than 500 minutes per week (< 500)
- `medium`: between 500 and 1000 minutes per week (>= 500 and < 1000)
- `high`: greater than 1000 minutes per week (>= 1000)

Apply this function to the `pa` DataFrame to create a categorical variable called `total_pa_cat`

```{python}
# your code here
def cat_var_tot_pa (m_per_w):
    if m_per_w < 500:
        return 'low'
    elif m_per_w >= 500 and m_per_w < 1000:
        return 'medium'
    else:
        return 'high'
cat_var_tot_pa_vec=np.vectorize(cat_var_tot_pa)
pa['total_pa_cat']=cat_var_tot_pa_vec(pa['total_pa_m_wk'])
pa
```

## Step 8: Visualize data with plotly express

In this section you will use `pa` to generate some plots!

### Plot 1: Histogram

Histograms are best used to visualize the distribution of a single numeric (continuous) variable. Choose a variable from the dataset that you can plot a histogram with.

Using plotly express, create and print a histogram.

```{python}
# your code here
pa_total_pa_cat=px.histogram(pa,x='bmi')
pa_total_pa_cat
```

### Plot 2: Boxplot

Boxplots are best used to visualize the distribution of a numeric variable, split by the values of a discrete/categorical variable.

Use plotly express to create and print a boxplot.

Use the same variable used for your histogram on your y-axis, and plot it against a categorical variable on your x-axis.

Set fill color to match the values of your categorical variable.

```{python}
# your code here
pa_box=px.box(pa,x='total_pa_cat',y='bmi',color='total_pa_cat')
pa_box
```

Write a short explanation of what you see in the plot.
